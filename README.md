My program has these functionalities:

• Checks if a date is reserved;

• Makes a reservation for a chosen check-in and check-out dates;

• Prevents concurrent reservations, and informs the user about the resource already being reserved at the given point in time;

• Saves information on customers and loads from separate files;

• Connects the customer information to the reservation;

• Creates a calendar view that shows the reservation times of the resources and can be used to make new reservations;

• Saves historical data on customers, which can be searched and viewed;

• Contains unit tests for the part of the program;

• Attaches the additional services to the reservations;

• Uses the length of the time slot and the reserved services to calculate a price, and prints it out for the user;

• Checks the reservations on the date determined by the user and prints out the checked-in and checked-out guests;

• Checks if the user has access to the system by checking the entered username and password;
